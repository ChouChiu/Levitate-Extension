# Contributing to Levitate Extension

English | [中文](CONTRIBUTING_ZH.md)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Levitate Extension! This guide will help you get started.

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (package manager)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Levitate-Extension.git
   cd Levitate-Extension
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

4. Open the project in VS Code and press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host.

## Project Architecture

This extension follows the standard VS Code [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) architecture:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph VSCode["VS Code Host"]
        Grammar["Grammar\n(syntax highlight)"]
        Client["Client\n(activation, commands)"]
    end
    Client -- "LSP connection" --> Server["Server\n(completion, diagnostics, hover)"]
```

| Module | Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Grammar** | `packages/grammar/` | TextMate grammar for syntax highlighting, language configuration (brackets, comments, etc.) |
| **Client** | `packages/client/` | Extension entry point — activates the extension, starts the language server, registers commands |
| **Server** | `packages/server/` | Language server — provides auto-completion, diagnostics, hover info, document symbols |

## Development Workflow

### Build

Builds both client and server with sourcemaps enabled:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/client/extension.js` and `dist/server/server.js`.

### Watch Mode

Automatically rebuilds on file changes — recommended during development:

```bash
pnpm run watch
```

### Lint & Format

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting.

```bash
# Check for lint issues
pnpm run lint

# Auto-format all files
pnpm run format
```

A pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` automatically to format staged files before each commit.

### Package

Build and package the extension into a `.vsix` file for distribution:

```bash
pnpm run package
```

## Debugging

### Client (Extension Host)

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Press `F5` to launch the **Extension Development Host** (a separate VS Code window with the extension loaded).
3. Set breakpoints in `packages/client/src/` — they will be hit when the extension activates.
4. The Debug Console in the original VS Code window shows `console.log` output and breakpoint inspection.

The launch configuration (`.vscode/launch.json`) automatically runs `pnpm run build` before launching.

### Server (Language Server)

The language server runs as a separate Node.js process. To debug it:

1. In the Extension Development Host, open a `.lvt` file to trigger the server to start.
2. Open VS Code's **Output** panel and select **Levitate** from the dropdown to see server logs.
3. To enable verbose logging, set `levitate.trace.server` to `verbose` in VS Code settings (Settings > Extensions > Levitate):
   ```json
   {
     "levitate.trace.server": "verbose"
   }
   ```
4. To attach a debugger to the server process, add this to `.vscode/launch.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Attach to Server",
     "type": "node",
     "request": "attach",
     "port": 6009,
     "restart": true,
     "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/server/**/*.js"]
   }
   ```
   Then update the server launch args in the client to include `--inspect=6009`.

### Grammar Debugging

To debug TextMate grammar issues:

1. Open a `.lvt` file in the Extension Development Host.
2. Use **Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes** (`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I` / `Cmd+Shift+Alt+I`) to see which scopes are applied to each token.
3. Compare the scopes against `packages/grammar/syntaxes/lvt.tmLanguage.json`.

## Adding Features

### Adding a New Keyword

1. **Grammar**: Add the keyword to `packages/grammar/syntaxes/lvt.tmLanguage.json` in the appropriate pattern (e.g., `keywords`, `control`, `subcommands`).
2. **Server completion**: Register the keyword in the completion provider in `packages/server/` so it appears in auto-suggestions.
3. **Server hover**: Add hover documentation for the keyword in the hover provider.
4. **Diagnostics**: If the keyword has specific syntax rules, add validation in the diagnostics provider.
5. **Localization**: Add descriptions in both `package.nls.json` (English) and `package.nls.zh-cn.json` (Chinese).

### Adding a New Subcommand

Subcommands follow the same steps as keywords, but are typically added to the `subcommands` section of the grammar and may have their own completion/hover entries.
